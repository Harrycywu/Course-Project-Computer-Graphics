# Final Project - Animated 3D Graphics
**Introduction**

The goal of this assignment is to give you a chance to apply all that you have learned to a project of your own choosing.

* Created a scene with several animated 3D graphics with OpenGL C++

I developed my own galaxy with a partial solar system (i.e., Sun-Moon-Earth) and several orbiting and spinning textured stars. A distorted textured sun and a cat-living star are stationary, and others are moving and rotating. For a fixed star, several planets are orbiting it. A textured car is transferring back and forth between two systems through textured torus and peculiar wormholes (i.e., Animated BÃ©zier curves). And animal objects are living inside the stars. Also, I enabled several keys (0~5: lights and f: animation) to control the lights and animation, and I added nine viewing options from different positions.

Note: 

Texture images are from the following website: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/

**How to run the program**

Use the Makefile provided to compile the main program: fp.cpp

`g++ -framework OpenGL -framework GLUT fp.cpp -o fp -Wno-deprecated`
```
$ make
$ ./fp
```
